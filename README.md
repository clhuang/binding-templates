# Binding Templates

This is a Haskell program to generate ski binding
mounting templates in SVG given a boot sole length (BSL).

Be on the safe side and treat all templates as unverified:
Test mount your gear on 2x4s and check the mid sole
point for correctness before drilling into skis.

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**


# Recommended Instructions

1. Print the template that matches your BSL.
   Verify the correct print scaling.
   From crosshair to crosshair on the mid sole mark is 190 mm.
2. Join the two template sheets together by aligning the
   mid sole marks of each page.  It helps to cut out the center of
   the two crosshairs on one page.
3. Using masking tape, mark the desired mid sole locations
   on both skis.  Put the skis together to verify 
   the mid sole mark is the same.
4. Place two pieces of masking tape on the middle of each ski
   at the approximate locations of the paper edge of the template.
   Using a marking gauge or calipers, mark the centerline
   of the ski on the masking tape.
5. Place the template on the ski, aligning the mid sole marks
   and the centerline.
   It helps to cut a hole on the mid sole line so you can 
   see the mid sole line on the ski through the template.
6. With the template aligned and taped to the ski, mark the
   holes for drilling with a center punch.


# Recommended Tools

- An [optical center punch](https://www.fowlerprecision.com/Products/Scribers/525000750.html)
  for precision hand drilling.
- A [marking guage](https://www.leevalley.com/en-us/shop/tools/hand-tools/marking-and-measuring/marking-gauges/75849-veritas-micro-adjust-wheel-marking-gauge)
  for finding the ski's centerline.
- A high quality [mini drill press](https://www.grizzly.com/products/grizzly-variable-speed-mini-benchtop-drill-press/t32006)
  for straight, accurate holes.
- A [tap](https://www.bindingfreedom.com/12ab3-alpine-tap-tin-coated/) for standard alpine binding screws.
- A nice long [tap wrench](https://www.starrett.com/metrology/product-detail/93E) to ensure good tap alignment.
