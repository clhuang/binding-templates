# Binding Templates

This is a Haskell program to generate ski binding
mounting templates in SVG given a boot sole length (BSL).
Currently bindings supported include Look Pivot and SPX, Salomon Shift, and 
Marker Jester, Griffon, and Squire.
Tyrolia templates are provided, but have not been verified.

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**


# Recommended Instructions

1. Print the template that matches your BSL.
   Verify the correct print scaling.
   From crosshair to crosshair on the midsole mark is 190 mm.
2. Join the two template sheets together by aligning the
   midsole marks of each page.  It helps to cut out the center of
   the two crosshairs on one page.
3. Using masking tape, mark the desired midsole locations
   on both skis.  Put the skis together to verify 
   the midsole mark is the same.
4. Place two pieces of masking tape on the middle of each ski
   at the approximate locations of the paper edge of the template.
   Using a marking gauge or calipers, mark the centerline
   of the ski on the masking tape.
5. Place the template on the ski, aligning the midsole marks
   and the centerline.
   It helps to cut a hole on the midsole line so you can 
   see the midsole line on the ski through the template.
6. With the template aligned and taped to the ski, mark the
   holes for drilling with a center punch.
