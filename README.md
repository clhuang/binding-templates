# Binding Templates

This is a Haskell program to generate ski binding
mounting templates in SVG given a boot sole length (BSL).

Be on the safe side and treat all templates as unverified:
Test mount your gear on 2x4s and check the mid sole
point for correctness before drilling into skis.

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**

# Recommended Tools

- An [optical center punch](https://www.fowlerprecision.com/Products/Scribers/525000750.html)
  for precision drilling.
- A [marking guage](https://www.leevalley.com/en-us/shop/tools/hand-tools/marking-and-measuring/marking-gauges/75849-veritas-micro-adjust-wheel-marking-gauge)
  for finding the ski's centerline.
- A high quality [mini drill press](https://www.grizzly.com/products/grizzly-variable-speed-mini-benchtop-drill-press/t32006)
  for straight, accurate holes.
- A [tap](https://www.bindingfreedom.com/12ab3-alpine-tap-tin-coated/) for standard alpine binding screws.
- A nice long [tap wrench](https://www.starrett.com/metrology/product-detail/93E) to ensure good tap alignment.
- A comfy [Pozi #3 screwdriver](https://www.bindingfreedom.com/screw-drivers/).
